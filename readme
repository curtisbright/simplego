Simple Go: A simple implementation of the game Go
by Curtis Bright, http://www.curtisbright.com/simplego/

Every Go player who is also a programmer ought to make a Go implementation sometime; this is mine.  Its main features are:

* Cross-platform GUI using wxWidgets
* Play against GNU Go on Linux
* Unlimited undo
* Superko enforced
* Option to allow suicide
* Area scoring using GNU Go on Linux (dead groups must be explictly killed on Windows)
* Load and save SGF files
* Random mode where play continues until both players have no legal moves
