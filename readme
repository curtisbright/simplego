Simple Go: A simple implementation of the game Go
by Curtis Bright, http://www.curtisbright.com/simplego/

Every Go player who is also a programmer ought to make a Go implementation sometime; this is mine.  Its main features are:

* Cross-platform GUI using wxWidgets
* Unlimited undo
* Superko enforced
* Option to allow suicide
* Area scoring (though dead groups must be explictly killed)
* Can save games to SGF
* Random mode where play continues until both players have no legal moves
